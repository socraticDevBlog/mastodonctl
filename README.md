# mastodonctl

cli client for mastodon social media platform

## installation

💡 `gnu/linux` and `macOs` are machines on which we work on. while it is
possible to work over `Windows`, our helpful documentation and scripts won't be
available to you...

since we don't provide pre-built binaries, having Go installed on your machine
is required. Follow this link: [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)

0. Clone repo to your local machine (fork repo if you intend to be a Contributor!)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/socraticDevBlog/mastodonctl.git
   ```

1. setup golang common configurations in your `.bashrc`, or `.zshrc`, or else configuration file:

```
# make Golang binary available from your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# set your GOPATH (if 'go' directory doesn't exist, create it beforehand)
export GOPATH=$HOME/go

# make mastodonctl executable binary available from your PATH
export PATH=$PATH:${GOPATH}/bin/mastodonctl
```

2. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   source ./setup.sh
   ```

`mastodonctl` is now available as CLI tool! 🚀

## configurations

As an experienced user, you may want to customize your commandline-tool.

This is possible by editing [`conf.json`](conf.json) file

### configurable values

| field               | description                                         |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ResultsDisplayCount | number of results displayed in your terminal        |
| ApiUrl              | URL of targetted mastodon server                    |
| AuthToken           | auth token required to interact with a server's API |

## current available commands

### hashtag

query Mastodon server's API for a specific hashtag

```bash
mastodonctl hashtag duck
```

### userinfos

\* requires auth token for the server used

Will query Mastodon server's API for user infos based on their `username`

## suggested way to store private credentials

populate `AuthToken` field in [conf.json](conf.json) configuration file

⚠️ never commit `conf.json` file to `git` version control

## start working on local machine

try out a few commands to see if everything is working properly

### list users by username

```bash
go run . accounts dave
```

Expect:

<img src="img/userinfos.PNG" alt="ctl results for userinfos"/>

### hashtag

Will query Mastadon server's public API for latest post tagged with a specific hashtag

```bash
go run . hashtag cat
```

Expect:

<img src="img/tablemastodon.png" alt="ctl results for cat"/>

## freely available Mastodon apps

- [mastovue](https://mastovue.glitch.me/#/vis.social/federated/duck)
- [mastoview](http://www.unmung.com/mastoview)

## my local Golang setup

- my `.profile` file

```bash
# golang configs
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH="$GOPATH/bin:$PATH"

# mastodonctl
# a valid conf.json file located beside mastodonctl binary
export MASTODONCTL_CONFIG_FILEPATH="$GOPATH/bin/conf.json"
```

## Docker containerize your CLI

if you don't have Golang set up on your machine or don't want to modify it, you can try
out mastodonctl using Docker!

build the image locally

```bash
docker build -t mastodonctl:latest .

docker run mastodonctl:latest
```

if you already have a valid Mastodonc API token, you can run any `mastodonctl`
available commands

```bash
docker run --env AUTH_TOKEN=<replace with your Mastodon API token> mastodonctl:latest accounts gargron
```
